Enhanced Block Truncation Coding Image using Digital Multi-tone Screen

Abstractâ€” An improved version of Block Truncation Coding
(BTC) termed Multitone Block Truncation Coding (MTBTC) is
proposed. The presented framework exploits the digital multi
toning strategy to obtain a superior quality BTC images.
Previously, the halftone techniques such as ordered dithering,
error diffusion and dot diffusion are extended to obtain different
version of BTC. Though it performs good, there are still many
scope for improvements. In recent times digital multitoning is
gaining prominence and advanced multitone screens such as
direct multibit search and clustered dot screens are developed.
This multitone screen can enhance the visual quality significantly
and offer more homogenous and noise free output for halftone
images. Considering this properties, an upgradation to the
halftone based BTC is proposed in this paper through the use of
sophisticated multitone screens. From the simulation results, it is
concluded that the proposed framework can provide very high
quality output than any existing BTC techniques. Another
highlighting aspect is that the proposed technique can facilitate
higher block size processing and it is computationally very simple.
In overall, the proposed scheme is an ideal candidate to implement
compression for high resolution images and can be exploited
further to adopt in artificial intelligent tasks.
